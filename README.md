# CSI Hackathon Jan 2019
This is a C++ based console application for the hackathon hosted by CSI at Chitkara University in Jan 2019. This is built by me (@rajatgupta1998), @adi199 and @ptiwari2701 .

Technologies used for this console applet:
C++ C CMake GNU make

# Introduction

This entire platform is supposedly governed by a virtual government. It is divided into 3 sectors:

1. Government
2. Corporate(s)
3. Startup(s)


A corporate gives a challenge statement to the budding developers' startups and they solve them. The stakeholders monitor the 
development activity and bid accordingly. The government governs the entire activity and can alter this entire database.
This applet is capable of checking the development cycle and we might later add a feature to enable bidding from the investors.
