# FAQ

This entire platform is suppossedly governed by a virtual government. It is divided into 3 sectors:

1. Govt
2. Corporate
3. Startups


A Corporate gives a challenge statement to the budding developers and a startup solve them. The stakeholders monitor the 
development activity and bid accordingly. The govt. governs the entire activity and alter the database. This applet is capable of checking the development cycle and we might later add a feature to enable bidding.
